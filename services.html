          All the knowledge I will share with you is peer-reviewed literature and proven to be effective. I take great pride in my education from the Kinesiology department at ASU. Improving health and wellness is my primary objective.<p></p>

              <h6 class="p1">Weight Loss</h6>
                I customize every client's nutrition  program to their needs. These will not be pre-written diets because everyone is  different! I will also show you the correct exercise and cardio program to  maximize your body's ability to use fat as a fuel!</p>

              <h6 class="p1">Strength and Conditioning</h6>
              <p>Simple  theory, there are no tricks or short cuts to getting stronger. SAID principle  states (specific adaptations to imposed demands) by making your muscle do more  than it has previously, the strength and size of the muscle will improve.  Obviously it's not that simple and that is why you are here! I will show you  the correct exercises and form to improve your sport and exercise performance.</p>
               <h6 class="p1">Functional Training</h6>
              <p>Make your everyday tasks easier! Are you sick of  losing your breath after a flight of stairs? Tired of throwing your back out  after picking something up? This will be the answer for you!              </p>
